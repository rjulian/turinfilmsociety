<p><h3>Wild Strawberries</h3></p>

<p>May 2025 will feature the Ingmar Bergman classic <i>Wild Strawberries</i>. Every aspect of being a classic is tackled in this film: coming from the late 1950s, dabbling in existential questions, and unforgettable characters. 

<p>We look forward to conversation and debate about <i>Wild Strawberries</i> on May 15th at 8pm at Marg√≤ in Vanchiglia.</p>
