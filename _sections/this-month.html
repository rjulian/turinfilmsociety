<p><h3>Mulholland Drive</h3></p>

<p>March 2025 will feature the David Lynch masterpiece <i>Mulholland Drive</i>. This neo-noir is packed with acting talent and dreamlike mystique, giving it staying power and lots to discuss. While a young film at just a bit over 20 years old, it's safe to say that <i>Mulholland Drive</i>, much like the famed director himself will go down as film legends. 

<p>We look forward to conversation and debate about <i>Mulholland Drive</i> on March 20th at 8pm at Marg√≤ in Vanchiglia.</p>
