<p><h3>The Battle of Algiers</h3></p>

<p>August 2025 goes to Italy and Algeria with <i>La battaglia di Algeri</i> (The Battle of Algiers). Filmed not long after the Algerian War, this classic is truly a unique ride that seems far more modern than it actually is. Known for its revolutionary use of newsreel style footage and its focus on the grim realities of an insurgency, <i>The Battle of Algiers</i> packs in a mighty punch. 

<p>We cannot wait to recount our views of <i>The Battle of Algiers</i> with you in person on August 21st at 8pm at Marg√≤ in Vanchiglia.</p>
