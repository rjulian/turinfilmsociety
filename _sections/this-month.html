<p><h3>8 1/2</h3></p>

<p>November 2025 we go <i>avanguardia</i> with Federico Fellini's masterpiece <i>8 1/2</i> (Otto e mezzo). A film about the creative process, but not. A film about films, but not. A summary of the ride that is <i>8 1/2</i> would never do it justice. 

<p>We cannot wait to discuss theories and findings in <i>8 1/2</i> with you in person on November 20th at Marg√≤ in Vanchiglia.</p>
